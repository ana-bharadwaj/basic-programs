/**
 * You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have.
 * Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
 * Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
 * Output: 3
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
 * Output: 0
